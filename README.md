# Bank_Loan_Analysis
Loan approval analysis
Problem Statement

This project aims to analyze loan application data using Power BI to identify key factors that
influence whether a loan is approved or denied (Loan Status). The dataset includes customer
information such as current loan amount, term, credit score, annual income, employment duration,
home ownership status, monthly debt, credit history, and more.

The analysis will focus on uncovering patterns and relationships between these variables and the
final loan status. By creating interactive dashboards, the project will help answer questions such as:

Do higher credit scores lead to more approvals?

How does home ownership affect loan status?

Is there a connection between bankruptcies or tax liens and loan rejections?

The overall goal is to provide insights that can help financial institutions better assess loan
applications and manage risk more effectively.
